          <span class="text-3xl mr-2">Arrow function</span>The value of this in
          case of arrow function is considerably different from that of regular
          function. Arrow function doesn't define it's own context of execution.
          The value of this inside an arrow function is the same as that of it's
          outer function. In other words, arrow function resolve the value of
          this lexically and this behavior is independent of how and where the
          function is executed.

          <br />
          <span class="text-3xl mr-2">Let</span> is a major improvement from the
          var keyword. Variables declared with the let keyword are block scoped.
          A block is any code written in between the curly brackets — { }. Block
          scoped variables are only accessible within that block. <br /><br />
          <span class="text-3xl mr-2">Const</span> is used for variables with a
          constant value. The value of the const variable will never change
          throughout the lifetime of the program. Just like let, const is also
          block scoped, i.e. it is restricted to the block in which it is
          declared. When declaring variables with const, it is necessary to
          initialize it with a value. Doing this, would result in an error:
